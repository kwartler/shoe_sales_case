Green plaid flannel makes up the design’s toe wrap and heel tab, while brown and red canvases cover the vamp, side panels, eyestays, and heel. On the side panel, canvas Three Stripes branding overlaps white and neon green flower embroidery. Lastly, a clear heel unit, ""Super Earth"" script on the tongue, and a cream Torsion sole round out this Earth-friendly design.

The Taupe Blue separates itself from previous Yeezy Desert Boots by presenting a design with strong contrast in its elements.
<br>
<br>
While previous Desert Boot releases have primarily featured colorways of subtle earth tones, the Taupe Blue taps into a more saturated palette. It features a tonal-brown upper that is composed of a mix of suede, nubuck, and mesh. From there, a solid Taupe Blue mudguard and sole seamlessly grip the upper to provide a sturdy base for traction and support. Olive rope laces add the finishing touches to this utilitarian design.

The adidas Ultra Boost DNA LEGO turns the popular running sneaker into a playful companion to the famous LEGO brick. The sneaker is composed of a majority white upper, with raised details on the toe box resembling the blocks. From there, the classic cage encases the upper’s sides as the Three Stripes are carved out to let the wearer add in one of the 144 colorful LEGO pieces that come with every pair. This additional accessory to the pair gives the wearer full customizing control. Lastly, a metallic silver toe wrap and heel cap bring more flare to the playful sneaker.

The Flaming Moe was first introduced as the Flaming Homer in the third season of The Simpsons, when Homer created a bizarre drink that contained cough syrup. The drink was so good that Homer’s friend and regular bartender, Moe, stole the recipe, renamed it the Flaming Moe, and took credit for inventing it at his eponymous bar. 
<br>
<br>
The adidas ZX 1000 Simpsons Flaming Moe's features a purple mesh and Nubuck upper with hits of red, orange, and yellow on the Three Stripes branding and flame detailing. The metal deubré references the Flaming Moe cocktail, with flames rising out of the glass. A white and red Torsion sole adds the finishing touches.

A hard gray midsole with a ridged, cream-colored sole offsets the soft fabric and neutralizes the pale blue. The dash of peach offers the perfect counterbalance to the blues and grays, turning the adidas Yeezy Boost 700 V2 Inertia into a cheerful sneaker that was made for a spring release.

The two entities are no stranger to each other, as the EU sneaker boutique has partnered with the Three Stripes on multiple occasions, most notably their 2019 If ZX 10,000C If I Can I Will project. In 2021, Overkill dropped their most colorful release yet, highlighting Stockholm’s love for graffiti.

<br>
The adidas ZX 8500 Overkill merges the ZX 8000 and 9000 models together, creating a brand new hybrid for the Three Stripes. The new amalgamation is introduced featuring a plethora of neon-colored accents featured on top of the upper’s Crystal White base. A black embroidered ""Overkill"" appears on the toe box, while Overkill’s logo is merged with a Fire Hazard symbol, resembling what is usually seen on spray cans. The most eye-catching design choice is the addition of multiple overshoes in a variety of matching neon colors to protect the shoes from paint splatter if one were to wear them while tagging walls.
